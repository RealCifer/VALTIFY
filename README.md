## This is CryptVault!

The primary goal of CryptVault was to foster a deeper understanding of how cryptographic algorithms work. Initially developed as an educational tool to demonstrate encryption, decryption, and hashing processes, the project evolved with production-level design and energy.

And this is the result:

> **A versatile platform to perform various cryptographic operations using state-of-the-art algorithms.**  
Whether you need to hash data, generate secure passwords, or implement advanced encryption techniques, CryptVault has you covered.

### 2. RSA (Rivestâ€“Shamirâ€“Adleman)

- **Key Generation**: Generate a public-private key pair by selecting a key size (e.g., 512 bits).
- **Encryption**: Encrypt plaintext using the public key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt ciphertext using the private key.

![RSA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98975069/247180951-3059f75f-e7a4-4b3b-b206-c726df058d92.png)

**Flow**:  
Generate RSA keys â†’ Encrypt message with public key â†’ Decrypt with private key.

### 3. Triple DES (3DES)

Triple DES enhances security by encrypting data three times with different keys.

**Flow**:  
Input plaintext â†’ Encrypt using Triple DES â†’ View ciphertext.

---

### 4. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

AES offers a secure and efficient method for data encryption.

### 5. SHA-256 and SHA-512

Cryptographic hash functions that generate fixed-size hash values.

![SHA-256](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98975069/247180969-403b8d47-0135-4fa0-889a-47053029910a.png)
![SHA-512](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98975069/247180972-dfae7288-5f78-4cf8-b142-6a1c6dfc41d5.png)

**Flow**:  
Input data â†’ Hash with SHA-256 or SHA-512 â†’ View hash output.

## ðŸ§© How It Works

- **Input**: User provides plaintext or data for encryption or hashing.
- **Process**:
  - Encryption Algorithms (RSA, 3DES, AES): Generate ciphertext.
  - Hashing Algorithms (SHA-256, SHA-512): Generate fixed-size hash.
- **Output**: Result is displayed in real-time.
